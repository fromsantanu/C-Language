## 2. **Keywords in C**

**Keywords** are reserved words in C that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used for naming variables or functions. C has 32 keywords, each serving a specific purpose in the language.

#### List of C Keywords:
```c
auto     double    int      struct
break    else      long     switch
case     enum      register typedef
char     extern    return   union
const    float     short    unsigned
continue for       signed   void
default  goto      sizeof   volatile
do       if        static   while
```

### Example:
```c
int main() {
    int number = 5;  // `int` is a keyword used to define an integer variable
    return 0;        // `return` is a keyword used to return a value from the function
}
```
