## 1. **History of C**

The C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs**, as part of the development of the UNIX operating system. Its roots can be traced back to earlier programming languages, particularly **B** and **BCPL**, which inspired the creation of C.

C became widely popular due to its simplicity, efficiency, and portability. It was initially designed to help write system software, specifically the UNIX operating system. Over time, C has evolved and laid the foundation for many modern programming languages such as **C++**, **Java**, **Objective-C**, and **C#**. Its importance is evident as it is still used in operating systems, embedded systems, and application development.

Key milestones in C's history:
- **1972**: Initial development of C by Dennis Ritchie.
- **1978**: Publication of **"The C Programming Language"** by **Brian Kernighan** and **Dennis Ritchie**, standardizing many features.
- **1989**: The first standardized version of C, known as **ANSI C** or **C89**.
- **1990**: International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted the standard, which became known as **ISO C**.
- **1999 and 2011**: Updated standards, known as **C99** and **C11**, respectively, introduced several modern features to the language.
